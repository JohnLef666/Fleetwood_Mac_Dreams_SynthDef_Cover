**Description**

As philosopher George Santayana famously quoted; “Chaos is a name for any order that produces confusion in the human mind”. 

In an effort to get somewhat acquainted with the overwhelmingly vast, confusing world of Music Programming and get a glimpse of the order inside chaos, I decided to apply the same method that made me become interested in music in the first place and helped me progress when I was younger. That method was practicing already existing songs on an instrument. In this case, the “instrument” is SuperCollider and the song I selected is Dreams by Fleetwood Mac off their all-time classic album Rumors.

The cover was composed in context of the Music Programming module of Sonic Arts and Audio Technologies Master’s Degree, an interdepartmental program of School of Music & Audiovisual Arts, Departments of Music Studies and Audio and Visual Arts of Ionian University, Corfu, Greece.


**Goal**

The goal of this project was to understand some of the basic functions of SuperCollider and get comfortable enough on its environment in order to be able to produce sonic elements that I could later on use for my own compositions.


**Methodology/Steps**

After finding a code demonstrating simple SynthDefs by Bruno Ruviaro in sccode.org, I applied the methodology from my professor’s Mr. Iannis Zannos’s lectures and the tips from Eli Fieldsteel’s tutorials to create Pbinds that each represent the instruments of the original arrangement.

Initially, I tweaked the parameters of the drums, setting the tempo clock to the bpm of the original song and making a steady “four on the floor” rhythm using the SynthDefs of the drums.  Afterwards I composed the parameters of the bass as well as the melodies of the vocals and the guitars manually using the sawSynth sound.  The midinote Pseq was not a big issue due to the fact that I could calculate the numbers to find the corresponding notes in the chromatic scale. The biggest challenge proved to be the duration Pseq but as in any new knowledge, after a long process of trial and error I managed to make the durations sound as close to the original as possible. 

For the format of the duration Pseqs (regarding how to set everything up inside the brackets, which bracket is used where, how to write the rests etc.), I mainly consulted Eli Fieldsteel’s tutorial n. 10 on Pbinds as well as B. Ruviaro’s book: A Gentle Introduction to SuperCollider (Chapters 13.2, 14.6). 


**Result**

Through this process, I believe I gained a relative understanding of the capabilities of SuperCollider and managed to shift my perspective of the medium from an incomprehensible new world to a powerful tool that can actually be used to compose and – dare I say- have fun with. 

My next step from here would be to try and compose a piece of my own, rather than make a cover of another artist.
